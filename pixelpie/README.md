# PixelPie

This algorithm implemented uniform Poisson-disk sampling code is
described by:

* PixelPie: Maximal Poisson-disk Sampling with Rasterization
  C.Y. Ip, M.A. Yalcin, D. Luebke, and A. Varshney
  High-Performance Graphics 2013

It currently contains only the uniform sampling code and it requires
CUDA 4.2.  We are working on port it to CUDA 5.0 and releasing the
importance sampling extention soon.

This software is available for research and non-commerical use.
